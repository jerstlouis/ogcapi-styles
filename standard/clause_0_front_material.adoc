[big]*i.     Abstract*

This document is the first part of the candidate standard OGC API - Styles that defines API building blocks for Web APIs to enable map servers and clients as well as visual style editors to manage and fetch styles.

Web APIs are software interfaces that use an architectural style that is founded on the technologies of the Web.
Styles consist of symbolizing instructions that are applied by a rendering engine on features and/or coverages.

This document uses "Styles API" to refer to a Web API that implements API building blocks specified in this candidate standard.

A Styles API supports several types of consumers, mainly:

* Visual style editors that create, update and delete styles for datasets that are shared by other Web APIs implementing the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core standard or the draft OGC API - Coverages or draft OGC API - Tiles specifications;
* Web APIs implementing the draft OGC API - Maps specification fetch styles and render spatial data (features or coverages) on the server;
* Map clients that fetch styles and render spatial data (features or coverages) on the client.

Feature data is either accessed directly or organized into spatial partitions such as a tiled data store (aka "vector tiles").

The API building blocks implement the conceptual model for styles, style encodings and style metadata as documented
in link:http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/19-023r1.html#Metadata[chapter 6] of the "OGC Testbed-15: Encoding and Metadata Conceptual Model for Styles Engineering Report".

The model defines three main concepts:

1. The **style** is the main resource.
2. Each style is available in one or more **stylesheets** - the representation of a
style in an encoding like OGC SLD 1.0 or Mapbox Style. Clients will use the
stylesheet of a style that fits best based on the capabilities of available tools
and their preferences.
3. For each style there is **style metadata** available, with general descriptive
information about the style, structural information (e.g., layers and attributes),
and so forth to allow users to discover and select existing styles for their data.

This model directly maps to the resources and documents in a Styles API,
which supports the resources and operations listed in the Table below.
The `baseResource` is any API resource with which styles can be associated.
For a general purpose Styles API this will typically be the Landing Page.
For styles associated with a feature collection published via an API implementing
OGC API Features, the base resource would be the Collection (path `/collections/{collectionId}`).

This document uses link:http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.2[OpenAPI 3.0]
to specify the building blocks of the API.

[quote, OpenAPI Specification, Introduction]
____
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
