[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC API - Styles standard defines API building blocks for Web APIs to enable map servers and clients as well as visual style editors to manage and fetch styles.

This OGC API - Styles User's Guide provides a place to document the foundation knowledge needed to make use of the API. It also captures additional information which may prove useful to implementers. By capturing this information in a separate document, implementers have ready access to knowledge which may prove useful without cluttering up the standards themselves with non-normative information. It also allows for easy update of this knowledge without impacting the standards themselves.

[big]*ii.    Keywords*

The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues.

ogcdoc, OGC document, styles, symbology, cartography, openapi
